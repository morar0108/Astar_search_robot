# Astar_search_robot

Given the problem of finding the shortest path between two points, S and G in the plane. 
In addition, there are several polygonal obstacles in this plane (see picture) and it is necessary to avoid them. 
This example is a simplification of the situation where a robot has to navigate in a crowded space. 

Write Python code and use the A* algorithm to solve this problem. 
The robot earns 1000 points when it reaches the goal, and loses 1 point for every mm it travels. 
Choose the size of the plane so that it makes sense. After the robot reaches the goal, it teleports somewhere randomly in the level and must reach the goal again. 
This is repeated 100 times.
